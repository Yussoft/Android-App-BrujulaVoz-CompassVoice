# Android-App-BrujulaVoz-CompassVoice
BrujulaVoz is an android application created to learn about the orientation sensor and speech recognition. 

It has two activities, the first one has a speech recognition Activity that saves data given by the user, e.g. Norte 10 (the app is in 
Spanish), the first word (Cardinal point), is the direction the user is looking for and the second is a margin of error, for example Norte 
10 means the user will be facing the right direction when the sensor's values are in  the interval [-10,10] (north is the 0 degree). 

This information is sent to the second Activity which will have a compass image rotating thanks to the orientation sensor. 
The user will know when is in the right direction by hearing a the sound of a bell.

Sorry for my english, If I have any mistake please dont hesitate to contact me in order to solve it.
